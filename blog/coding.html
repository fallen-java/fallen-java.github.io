<h3 class="article">Python</h3>
<p class="article">After forgetting that programming existed in 2022, coming back to programming is a very hard feat.
When I started to get back into it, I tried doing Python. I was <i>struggling</i> to even make a program to say
<i>"Hi <code><i>insert name</i></code>, you are <code><i>insert age</i></code> years old!"</i> It was miserable. 
If you are wondering what the source code looks like, here you go:<br>
<code>name=input("What's your name? ")<br>
    age=input("How old are you? ")<br>
    
    name=name+","<br>
    
    
    print("Hi", name, "you are", age, "years old!")</code>

<h3 class="article">Blender</h3></p>
<p class="article">I also briefly tried learning Blender with <a class="light" href="https://www.youtube.com/@BlenderGuru" target="_blank">
    Blender Guru's</a> tutorial until everything started to break. My friend has showed me another tutorial I could watch, but I 
    cannot show you since I do not know who made it.
